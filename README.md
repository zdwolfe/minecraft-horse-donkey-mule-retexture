# Horse, Donkey, and Mule Retexture Resource Packs

This are two minecraft Resource Packs that add vanilla fixes and variations to the Minecraft horse, mule, and donkey mobs.

Requires the [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) mod. It may also work with Optifine, but has not been tested.


## Horse Retexture

[Download on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vanilla-horse-retexture)

Improves vanilla horse colors and patterns.

This resource pack fixes the white-on-white and black-on-black horse color combinations that sometimes occur in vanilla. Retexturing is one to one with no randomization (ie. every white horse with white spots will look exactly the same) to stick to a more vanilla Minecraft feel.
